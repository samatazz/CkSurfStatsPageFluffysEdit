# 1.3 -- 5/30/2017

-Added map tiers to the main menu
-Added pagination to map and profiles page to reduce load times
-Adjusted the theme settings to appear nicer
-Fixed a few mistakes (PHP errors and incorrect data being shown)
-Added temporary support for Marcowmaderia's fork of CKSurf which features stage records
-Added a fix_database.php file that will fix a charset issue with the cksurf database (Optional but delete when you're done with it)

**Note**

I need a copy of a database which features stage record data as I do not run my own server. If you would like to help out, please get in touch with me at my email, theoneandonly@rowedahelicon.com
In addition, in order to enable the Macro addition, add this line into your config.php file.

$use_marco_cksurf = '1';

Once I get some more data, I'll iron out any mistakes with stage records in a future update!
