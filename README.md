# Hello!

This is a simple web interface for the CS:GO plugin, CKSurf.

It was built with Bootstrap!

It is a basic stats display web page where you can view the leaderboard of different player's surf times.

You can see a working demo of this project here : http://www.rowedahelicon.com/workshop/stats/?view=home
